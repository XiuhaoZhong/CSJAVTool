  This project is consisted of several parts. 
  The major one is CSJAudioVideoTool, which is responsible the main UI and video renderer. The main UI is based Duilib and the  renderer is based OpenGL.
  CSJMediaPegTools is a project based FFMpeg. It has supported the some functionalities as far, such as extracting video/audio data from a mp4 file, trasforming the media file's codec(mp4->flv etc.).
